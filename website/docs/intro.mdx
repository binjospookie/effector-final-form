# Introduction

Forms values and validation rules are part of the business logic. This means that you need to be able to work with them without being bound to the UI-framework.

The goal of this project is to combine [Final Form](https://final-form.org/) and [Effector](https://effector.dev/) to achieve the goal described above.

## Installation

:::note Be careful
You need to have installed [effector](https://effector.dev/) and [final-form](https://final-form.org/) packages
:::

```bash
yarn add effector-final-form
# or
npm add effector-final-form
# or
pnpm add effector-final-form
```

## Usage

Just import from the root module:

```ts
import { createForm } from 'effector-final-form';
```
